## Trying to re-write the old and minimal torchat for Python 3.5 and wx4
* Also probably bi-lingual or tri-lingual depending on the capacity
* Help would be appreciated
* Also I would like to pack it into an .exe file for portable Windows use


TorChat2
========
If you are looking for **TorChat 0.9.9.xxx** (the original Python
implementation) then please switch to the **torchat_py** branch.
For downloads of the latest versions please see the downloads
section: https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/downloads

Will be doing the rewrite in Python 3.5 and wx 4.x
* restarted the project

Notes
====


Although this project is abandoned and moved to other languages like Pascal and Java, I want to do a rewrite in Python
